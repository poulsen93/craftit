# ability to make some blocks worth more or less points. Helpful
# if you're honeypotting a region that is a honeypot statue,
# for example, so you could ignore dirt/snow blocks, etc.

# This defines which permission system is used. Vault and WEPIF
# (WEPIF is built into WorldEdit) are preferred, they both provide
# a nice interface to all other permission systems. If you don't have
# or don't want to use either of those, there is some native support
# for a few other permission systems that you can use. These are
# checked in the order they are listed for existence, and the
# first one to match is used.
permissions:
  - vault
  - wepif
  - pex
  - perm2-compat
